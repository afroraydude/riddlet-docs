Riddlet is a custom wrapper for Socket.IO that allows for anonymous chat between users.

There are two different parts:

## The Server

The server software, titled `riddlet-server` is what handles everything to do with server operations like authentication, message handling, and custom software.

## The client

The client can be a bot, web client, or mobile client.
